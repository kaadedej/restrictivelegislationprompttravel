        <p>After the overturn of Roe V. Wade, reproductive services have greatly decreased causing consequences in the healthcare of women across the United States. Today, more than 21 states have enacted bans or significant restrictions on the services, reshaping the landscape of reproductive rights in the country.</p>
        <p>Roe V. Wade was a landmark Supreme Court decision that struck down Texas laws that previously criminalized abortion, establishing the constitutional right to access abortion services. However, in 2022, the United States Supreme Court overturned this precedent with its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, dismantling the legal protections that were previously afforded to abortion rights and contraceptive care.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the overruling, individual states have now gained the authority to determine the level of reproductive care within their borders.</p>
        <p>A total of 13 states including Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, and Wyoming have all passed a total abortion ban that refers to the state having legislation that prohibits all forms of abortion care with limited exceptions. Four states including Iowa, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida have enforced a six-week abortion ban with limited expectations, which leaves the individual approximately four weeks after their last menstruation period to seek adequate care.</p>
        <p>Individuals who live in states with restrictive reproductive legislation have to either overcome the financial boundaries of seeking out-of-state care, carry an unwarranted pregnancy, or risk putting themselves in dangerous situations to have a self-regulated abortion.</p>
        <p>With the health risks attached to postponing essential reproductive care, sometimes there is no other choice. Washington D.C., Kansas, and New Mexico were some of the states that had a higher percentage of abortions done on out-of-state patients rather than patients in-state. These states all border states that have the most restrictive, or very restrictive abortion policies enacted in the states’ legislation.</p>

        <p>“It’s not as easy as it sounds, the state threatens clinc providers,” Dr. Jok Madut Jok, an Anthropology Professor at Syracuse University who has written extensively about gender, sexuality, and reproductive health in Sudan, stated. “Any clinic that performs an abortion in a state that it is not legalized in will get in trouble or even prosecuted for performing that care, so no one will perform it for a patient anyway.”</p>

        <p>Almost a million individuals will cross their state’s border to access essential care, according to <a href= "https://osf.io/k4x7t/">data </a> collected by the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
        <iframe title="How many out-of-state patients in each state received reproductive care." aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-lIWUF" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lIWUF/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="487" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>
        <p>Out-of-state patients mostly frequented the state of Illinois, with California and New York following as the states receiving the most out-of-state patients for care. Illinois, California, and New York are states that have policies that range from protective to very protective when it comes to ensuring abortion rights, as depicted by the <a href= "https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/abortion-policies"> Guttmacher Insitute.</a></p>
        <p>Illinois enacted the Reproductive Health Act in 2021, ensuring that the state government treats reproductive and maternal healthcare akin to all other forms of healthcare. The RHA establishes the right for individuals to make individual decisions regarding their reproductive health, including the right to use or refuse care. New York State recently passed the Proposition One amendment to their constitution ensuring reproductive rights for individuals in that state. California passed the Reproductive Privacy Act, protecting the privacy of individuals making reproductive decisions and restricting the use of the information being collected. </p>
        <p>However, out-of-state travel highlights the challenges related to access to reproductive care as for some individuals, traveling is not an option.</p>
        <p>“You then, have to deal with the challenges of buying a ticket, taking time off work, finding childcare--if you have other children--, and then, finding money to stay in a hotel,” Dr. Jok said. “Because it is nothing like an out-patient procedure, it is cumbersome and it is very medically taxing on the body. You get it performed, you have to recuperate, you have to go for post-operation recuperation, and more. So, you have to cough up a lot of money.”</p>
        <p>The average costs for medication abortion services add up to $595, and the average costs for first-trimester procedural abortion services add up to $664.</p>
        <iframe title="The cost of abortion care in states with protective reproductive laws." aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-ry8Lx" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ry8Lx/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="620" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>
        <p> The inaccessibility to reproductive care services poses significant risks for those seeking contraception, as well as for those who are pregnant. Imposing restrictions on safe abortion procedures and care increases the chances of unsafe abortions that pose significant risks to the individual.  “Physical health risks associated with unsafe abortion include: incomplete abortion (failure to remove or expel all pregnancy tissue from the uterus); haemorrhage (heavy bleeding); infection; uterine perforation (caused when the uterus is pierced by a sharp object); and damage to the genital tract and internal organs as a consequence of inserting dangerous objects into the vagina or anus.”, as stated on the World Health Organization’s website. </p>
        <p>This issue of strict abortion legislation across the country has forced many individuals to seek expensive, out-of-state options for safe and legal procedures, raising significant concerns about access to reproductive healthcare.</p>

        <p> “Americans are going to have to use the legal system to decide the fate of reproductive rights in this country: Do women have the right to decide to do with their bodies as they wish, do women have the right up to a certain limit, or does the state have the reason to decide?” Dr. Jok said.</p>
